  module Controller
    # Module provides authentification methods and helpers for puffer
    # controllers. Puffer's authentification system is simple. In general, you

    # partial access of different user types.

    # Method +has_puffer_access?+ with current namespace name as a parameter.
    # If you want to use appication's own auth system - just redefine this
    # method in your ApplicationController.

    # Also see Puffer::SessionsBase.
